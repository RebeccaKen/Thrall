### E-commerce Application Type
Thrall is a fictitious B2C e-commerce application catering to women's clothing, offering affordable options directly to the consumer. With a target demographic of women aged 18-34, Thrall focuses on providing a seamless and convenient shopping experience. The website is specifically designed to facilitate quick and easy single-payment purchases, catering to the impulse-buying behaviour commonly associated with B2C e-commerce. It is important to note that Thrall's platform is exclusively dedicated to serving individual customers and is not intended for selling merchandise to other businesses.

### Marketing Stratergy
Thrall's marketing strategy would leverage a substantial budget to effectively reach its target demographic. A key focus would be on utilizing Google Ads to enhance Thrall's SEO ranking, increasing visibility and attracting organic traffic. To establish trust with the target demographic, a combination of organic marketing tactics would be employed. This would involve creating fashion-oriented content specifically tailored to the audience and distributing it across Thrall's social media platforms.

Furthermore, Thrall would prioritize cultivating a robust social media presence, closely intertwined with a compelling influencer marketing strategy. By partnering with influential personalities who resonate with younger shoppers, Thrall aims to bolster its reputation through engaging content such as clothing hauls and reviews. To encourage product reviews across various social media platforms and YouTube, Thrall would offer an affiliate marketing program option or provide vouchers to influencers with an audience matching the demographic of the brand.

This user-generated content, generated through influencer partnerships, would subsequently be shared on Thrall's own social media pages, further amplifying its reach and engagement within the target demographic.
Regular newsletters would also be sent to a registered users inbox containing an overview of new products/sales and discount codes.
